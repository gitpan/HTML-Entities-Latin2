HTML/Entities/Latin2 version 0.04
=================================

This module was written to solve a problem I had which involved taking text data from a feed source and submiting it to a custom-built content management system (not my own). The problem was that the CMS could only handle ASCII text and the feed source was encoded in ISO-8859-2 (Hungarian). Since the eventual output was destined for a web page, an obvious solution was to encode all non-ASCII characters into their HTML entity equivalents. Unfortunately after an extensive search and an email exchange with Gisle Aas (author of HTML::Entities) I decided I would have to roll my own.

This module has one basic job: to take text which may contain high-bit chataracters encoded as Latin-2, find those characters and replace them with their HTML entity equivalents. The result is a string which contains only ASCII but when displayed in a web page will render the Latin-2 glyphs.
